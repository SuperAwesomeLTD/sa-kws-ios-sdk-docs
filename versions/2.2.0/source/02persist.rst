Persisting the user

Once a user is either created or authenticated, KWS will keep the user for 24 hours in user preferences or system defaults.

You can access the basic logged user details by calling:

.. code-block:: objective-c

  KWSLoggedUser *currentUser = [[KWS sdk] getLoggedUser];

The **KWSLoggedUser** object has the following fields:
