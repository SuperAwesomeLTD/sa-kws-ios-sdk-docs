.. note::

	Please note that depending on the available permissions you have (detailed in the **KWSPermissions** object) you may or may not
	see the various pieces of information associated with a user.

.. note::

  Also note that a parent may withdraw permission to access a user's details at any time. Your app should handle this scenario gracefully as well.
